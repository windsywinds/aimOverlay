aimOverlay
v 1.0
by Windsywinds

A simple and minimalist crosshair overlay application.


Troubleshooting:

Overlay loads and shows on screen but the hotkeys do not do anything:
The program needs to be running with admin privileges to use hot keys. Right click and select "run as administrator"
Alternatively, you can edit the config.ini file to manually set the crosshair style and size. The program can be closed via the tray icon
